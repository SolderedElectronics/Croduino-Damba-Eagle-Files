## Description and details
The Croduino Damba is a very small Arduino compatible board. It is sized just 22 x 26 mm (0.9 x 1 inch) and features a CR1220 battery onboard so it easily becomes a wearable. It is based on Attiny85 microcontroller which runs an Arduino bootloader.

To program this board you will need another Arduino board. The process of programming is made simple since there is a connector on Damba for plugging in directly in Arduino board (for example, Croduino Basic).
